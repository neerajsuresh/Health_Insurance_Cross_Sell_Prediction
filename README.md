# Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell_Prediction
## Introduction
The project focuses on predicting whether customers who have health insurance would also be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance. The dataset consists of 381,109 rows and 12 columns, forming the basis of the analysis.
## Objective
The main objective of the project is to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to adopt vehicle insurance. This model helps optimize the company's marketing strategy, leading to increased revenue and better resource allocation.
## Libraries and Tools Used
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Plotly Express for interactive visualizations.

Scikit-Learn for machine learning algorithms.

LabelEncoder for encoding categorical features.

MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.

SMOTE for addressing class imbalance.
## Data Overview
The dataset contains information about demographics, vehicle details, and policy information. Key features include Age, Gender, Vehicle Age, Vehicle Damage, Policy Sales Channel, and Response (target variable).
## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the potential of predictive modeling in identifying potential customers for vehicle insurance.
